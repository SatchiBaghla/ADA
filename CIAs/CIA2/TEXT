You have access to historical stock price real time data for the NIFTY-50 index, which represents the top 50 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India. Your task is to perform a time series analysis of the past 12 months data to gain insights and make predictions. Explore the NiFTY-50 stock data, identify trends, and build predictive models to forecast stock prices. Answer all the questions relevant to the dataset provided
1 Data Exploration:
    How would you handle missing values in the dataset? Explain different imputation techniques and their suitability for the given time series dataset.
    Visualize the dataset using line charts, scatterplots and histograms

2 Stationarity Check:
    Ensure the esxtracted time series data is stationary by performing the Augmented Dickey Fuller(ADF) or Kwiatowski-Philips-Schmidt-Shin(KPSS) test and give your interpretation
    If not stationary, take the necessary action

3 Model Selection and Evaluation
    Make predictions for the last month and assess accuracy. Consider visualizing actual vs predicted values
    Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error(MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)
    Explain the difference between ARIMA and SARIMA models. When would you prefer one over the other

4 Forecasting
    Forecast the stock price for the next One month
    Plot the forecasted values and the original time series data to visualize the forecast

5 Interpretation
