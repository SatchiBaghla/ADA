15,"The best T20I batter. If he's at the crease you know the match isn't over yet for India, he almost always finds a way to claw them back. 

He did it in 2016. Did it in 2022. Remember watching the India v Pakistan match in 2022, India's top order had collapsed and being like, Pakistan are favorites but you can never count Kohli out in run chase. And then he won the game for them. Just like that. One of the best innings I'll have ever watched. 

I remember Amir's brilliant spell against India in 2016. A low score set by Pakistan, but Mohammad Amir had given us some hope to winning this game. But no can do. In both India Pakistan matches in 2016 resulted in Kohli ensuring that India were going to win. 

Even today it was a typical Virat Kohli innings. Start slow, and accelerate later in the death. Yes he could've accelerated a bit sooner, but without his innings India would've had a below par score.

Carried India on his own for 5 World T20s straight, and finally wins the trophy in his 6th attempt and gets POTM in the final.

Remember he averages almost 50 with 135+ sr despite missing so many low stake bilaterals which would have boosted these numbers ever higher.

Both his otherworldly 82*s will be etched in the history books as a template for crafting and manufacturing a chase at your own pace when the games seemed all but gone. 

There will be many intent merchants in the future, but not many would touch the ceiling he has built with his own hands.

Hope we haven't seen the last of him in the other formats, because it is not easy to let go of once-in-a-generation legends. 

Kohli's retirement will be equivalent to that of legends like Sachin, Imran Khan, Viv Richards etc.

But the man never wavered off his resolve and produced clutch after clutch innings, playing what he felt was right. The only time he doubted his natural game was in this world cup, maybe coming off of the shitty pitches of this IPL, and his batting struggled.

Until today, where he again did what he felt was right. And if he had fell short at 48(46) then he would‚Äôve been villainised(rightly so). But he didn‚Äôt and now isn‚Äôt the time of shitty what ifs.

So, it‚Äôs appropriate to bid farewell to one of T20Is GOATs whose approach to the game was always behind the curve, till it wasn‚Äôt. The guy who‚Äôs 135SR 50 the team didn‚Äôt need till you were 10/3 and holding onto hope for a 82.",13,1719687290.0

We have known him to be extraordinarily disciplined when it comes to his diet, training etc. We count on him so much to play all roles - anchor and aggressor - that we forget that he is only human. He can have downs and no worse time for this to happen than a world cup. But, class is permanent. He gave us a glimpse of the Virat Kohli we all know. For one final time in T20 internationals.

I feel like the T20 games of India will now feel lackluster with Kohli and even Rohit. There was always relief in the heart as long as I saw the name Kohli on the screen, the amount of times he has saved India from a collapse can't even be counted, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes decades to even get close to replacement of Virat Kohli for ICT but it will never be the same. It'd feel so weird for a match to start for India and not seeing Kohli there, it's a feeling which will take a long time to settle to not see that name there. Hope he continues his Cricketing career for another CWC, CT and WTC, Age is not a factor ,he has that fitness in him. He will be so dearly missed in this format for what he has given to it.

Only thing remaining was a 50+ knock in final and winning the cup (he scored 35 in 2011 wc and 43 in 2013 CT both which we won).

But still, in his worst tournament, scoring more than the other innings combined, and that too in a final, without throwing away his wicket like he did in other games is what we wanted probably. I remember Samuels won the potm too in 2016 with a similar SR iirc, which was the need at that time.

In 2023 wc I'm sure many have the opinion that even though Rohit started great almost every match, even in the final, it would have been different if he stayed. So looking that way I'm glad kohli stayed. We probably wouldn't have crossed 150 otherwise who knows.",154,1719688682.0

There was no need to anchor in the 15th over with plenty of wickets in hand. Kohli's decision to prioritize his own milestones over team success meant that India wound up with a below par score.

Life is strange. If India's bowlers hadn't defended 30 off 30 with SA having 6 wickets in hand then everyone would have bashed Kohli.

We literally see what happened with SA with their big time intent guys who are loads better than Pandu-Jaddu-Dube lol. Klassen-Miller-Stubbs weren't able to do shit even after cruising through for 90% of the time my man. 

If Kohli had gotten out while playing intent role today, India would have had a 40-4/50-4 around 6th-7th over mark. Do you seriously think they would have made anything better than they made after that ? 

"" I am sure those extra 25 balls kohli ate in the middle overs could have been put to good use by them.""
And in the same way if our spinners  have bowled with a little brain we could have won 20-30 runs earlier too.

These are just mental gymnastics in the end. Those 25 balls are not a surety for Pandu-Jaddu to do wonders, maybe they could have got out in just 5, then what ?",10,1719690868.0

But he played that 82*(53) vs pak in t20wc 2022 Australia and the 100 vs NZ in semifinal in WC 2023 india.

Again the mental gymnastics is too strong here. Nobody even said anything close to this shithousery lol.

""We can't be sure if the everyone else will get out for 0.""
We are sure of something's here. Klassen-Miller-Stubbs is a bettee trio than Pandu-Dube-Jaddu anyday and they played great till they fucked it over because they didn't knew what to do with that 30 off 30. Inthe similar vein if Kohli had gotten out early while showing intent when we were at 30-3, India wouldn't have made 175+ this easily. You are literally forgetting the fact only Pandya was in proper form before this finals in this trio.
