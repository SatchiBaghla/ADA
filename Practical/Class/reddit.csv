9,1dpx2oe,What exactly has happened to Virat kohli? ,556,https://i.redd.it/c63cilyxg59d1.png,199,1719509627.0,"TL;DR - Criticism in IPL for low SR got to him. And he's still in that mindset.


For the majority of his career, the one thing that made Virat the player that he is - has been his understanding of the game. He always reads the condition, the demands of the match, better than anyone else.


So what happened this year? The criticism got to him. For a player who has been in form for the majority of his career. The  player who even in his under par years was the 2nd/3rd best batsmen of the team. The criticism of upping the ante became the new challenge for him.


Despite scoring loads of runs in the first half of IPL, he was criticised for his low SR. Virat as a player has always relied on 1s and 2s and an occasional boundary here and there, yet have had SR of 160s. He doesn't munch too many dot balls. But, to answer his critics, he tried to bash the balls and somehow it worked in the IPL. Largely because of batting friendly pitches, smaller grounds, quality bowlers getting diluted and in general lower standards of IPL teams than an international team.


Yashasvi jaiswal in an interview IPL 2024 said that Virat kohli has tought him how to play along the ground even in T20s and the importance pf running between the wicket. Virat this WC didn't even try to pick pockets for 2s, in the first over itself he was going for six.


What's disappointing for me is that in this T20 WC, the pitches were bowler friendly throughout the tournament. SR of even 120s would have sufficed in most of the game. This tournament was tailor made for his style of play. 1s and 2s and occasional boundaries. Yet, he is still playing the IPL in his mind trying to up the ante, going over the top, when there's uneven bounce. He should be brought 1 down so that he can better analyse what the pitch is doing before he gets into the ring. He's a star player, hope he gets back to what was working for him all these years.
